Starve your distractions, feed your focus.
You will never always be motivated, so you must learn to be disciplined.
The successful warrior is the average man, with laser-like focus. 
Small daily improvements over time lead to stunning results.
Success doesnt come from what you do occasionally, it comes from what you do consistently.
Don’t watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
Where focus goes, energy flows.
You don’t get results by focusing on results. You get results by focusing on the actions that produce results.
Lack of direction, not lack of time, is the problem. We all have 24-hour days.
Discipline is choosing between what you want now and what you want most.
Focus on being productive instead of busy.
Your future is created by what you do today, not tomorrow.
